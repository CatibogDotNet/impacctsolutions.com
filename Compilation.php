	<p> “Measurement is the first step that leads to control and eventually to improvement. If you can’t measure something, you can’t understand it. 
		If you can’t understand it, you can’t control it. If you can’t control it, you can’t improve it.” ― H. James Harrington</p>
	<p> Those who want to increase revenue and/or reduce costs need to measure them.  Let us help you "improve" your finances.</p>
	<p> We will compile the following financial statements from your submitted data:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> the statement of financial position</li>
		<li> the income statement</li>
		<li> the statement of cash flow</li>
		<li> the equity statement</li>
		<li> notes</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<p> Prepared by a Chartered Professional Accountant, the financial statements are acceptable to bankers, investors, creditors, clients, and others.
		Compilation steps include validating the balances in the asset, liability, and equity accounts such as:</p>
	<ul>	
			<li>Cash and Cash equivalents</li>
			<li>Accounts Receivable</li>
			<li>Inventory</li>
			<li>Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities</li>
			<li>Capital Assets</li>
	</ul>
	<p> No audit is performed and all reports are based on your management's data submissions.</p>
